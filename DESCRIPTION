Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rodrigo Arriaza

Description: Baum-Welch is a special case of Expectacion-Maximization Algorithm,
    that uses the forward-backward algorithm for calculating and updating the transition and emission
    matrices of a Hidden Markov Model for a given sequence where we only have access to the observable states
    and not to the hidden states.
